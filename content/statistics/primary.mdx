This report for %%NAME%% includes four main scores on the right. Those scores are percentiles, and they reflect how this %%UNIT%% measures on food access, market concentration, socioeconomic disadvantage, and residential segregation relative to all other %%UNIT\_PLURAL%% in the country. The data for this report is primarily based on 2021 Census Data (American Community Survey 2021 5-year estimates) and market data from 2023.
