      ***Food access*** here considers the availability and accessibility of
      food based on the supply (grocery stores) and demand (population) in a
      given area. We use a gravity model to calculate a food access score. The
      gravity model, commonly used in geography and economics, is adapted to
      measure food access by incorporating the following key components:


      1. Size of Grocery Stores: This factor accounts for the size, based on the
      sales figures, of food resources at each grocery stores. Larger stores
      with a wider range of fresh produce, for example, would have higher
      'size'.

      2. Distance or Travel Time: The ease of accessing food sources is
      influenced by the distance or travel time between demand points and supply
      points. Generally, shorter distances or quicker travel times increase the
      accessibility of food resources.

      3. Demand or Need for Food: This represents the population in a given
      area. Areas with higher populations or greater food insecurity have higher
      demand values.


      The food access score is relative to all other Census tracts in the United
      States, where 100 represents the best food access and zero (0) is the
      worst food access.
