* 6/3
  * Reorganized report pages to emphasize economic metrics
  * Added sticky nav on left side of report to organize sections
  * Added comparability for key metrics. You can now chose state, national, or county comparisons. This means that if you chose a given census tract (neighborhood level) by default it will show how that tract relates to the whole country. You can choose state, which will update scores based on the context of the state, and county for the context of the county. You can only compare to units larger than your current area (eg. County can view state and national, state can only view national).
  * Added persistence to comparability that will stay the same in between page views of the same unit.
