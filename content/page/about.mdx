      #### Methodology


      Food supply accessibility: To estimate food access, we use a gravity model
      with a floating catchment area (FCA). This data model represents
      accessibility scores for different locations, quantifying how easily
      people in a given area can access grocery stores. These scores account for
      both the amount of resources available (weighted by store sales) and the
      distance or travel time to these resources, applying a decay function that
      makes further away locations less valuable than nearby ones.


      This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of accessibility
      compared to a simple binary measure of whether a location is within a
      certain distance (eg. a grocery location within 1 mile or 10 miles). This
      complexity allows the model to better reflect real-world conditions where
      access diminishes with distance and is influenced by the concentration and
      capacity of resources. Thus, it offers a more detailed and actionable
      insight for planning and policy-making, identifying not just whether
      services are accessible, but how accessible they are in relative terms.


      To calculate the gravity model, we use the following steps:


      1. Define supply locations: we use the InfoGroup reference USA store
      locations coded as Grocery Stores, Warehouse Stores, Supercenters, and in
      some cases Dollar Stores. \
         \
         We weighted each location by its sales volume - in the case of Dollar Stores, Supercenters, and Warehouse Stores, we divide sales based on estimates of the percentage of sales that area food items. To compare values over time, we adjust for inflation (using CPI) and adjust for median income and goods pricing (where higher sales volumes in affluent areas may represent fewer total groceries sold, and the opposite may be true in lower income areas).
      2. Define demand locations: we use census data crosswalked to 2020 census
      tract geographies to estimate the number of people in a given area..

      3. Define travel time: we use the straight line distance between census
      block groups, aggregated to census tracts, to estimate the travel time
      between locations.

      4. Calculate the catchment areas: for the following steps, we use the
      Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL's) accessibility module. First, we
      calculate dynamical defines areas around each census tract based on the
      distance or time threshold that people are willing to travel to access a
      grocery store.\
         \
         A distance decay function is applied, which assumes that the attractiveness or utility of a grocery store decreases as the distance from the store increases. Our weighting is linear, (α=1) which means that a store would have to be twice as attractive for someone to travel twice as far. We use a distance threshold of 1.2km (β=1200) to estimate the threshold at which distance sensitivity starts to decay more rapidly. \\
      5. Calculate accessibility:  for each census tract, we calculate the
      accessibility score to grocery stores. We sum weighted supply values of
      all grocery stores within the catchment area, modified by the distance and
      supply of that store. The sum of all of the distance decayed supply values
      divided by the total demand reflects the food supply accessibility value.
      Other spatial access models may take into account competition for
      resources, which is very important for services that can hit capacity
      limits such as Healthcare, but in the case of grocery supply it is very
      rare in the US context that a store would be fully sold out of viable food
      supply. \\

      6. Normalize and interpret: for the food access score, we assign a
      percentile to each tract's accessibility score from 0 to 100 relative to
      all tracts. For counties and states, we calculate the population weighted
      average of accessibility scores for all the tracts within, and then assign
      a percentile relative to all counties or states.


      Market concentration: To estimate market concentration we use the
      Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a widely used measure of market
      concentration. HHI is particularly useful when assessing the competitive
      landscape of industries like grocery stores.


      To calculate HHI, we use the following steps:


      1. Estimate service areas / travel time tolerance: we want to measure the
      dominance of a particular grocery store or grocery parent company within a
      reasonable range that people might be willing to travel to access
      groceries. These ranges are based on the density of a place, where denser
      areas may be more sensitive to distance than a more rural or remote area.
      We assign distance ranges of 5 to 20 minutes driving time with average
      area traffic, based on reported ranges of how far people are willing to
      travel in the USDA FoodAPS survey. While many people in urban areas likely
      do not drive to the grocery store, the 5 minute range of driving roughly
      equates to a reasonable walking distance when traffic and street grids are
      considered.\
         \
         We assign a driving time of 5 to 20 minutes based on the density of a given census tract and its neighbors (spatial lagged value) to differentiate tracts that area next to urban areas but are less dense, and truly rural or remote areas. We take the density values and normalize them from 0 to 100, exponentially scale the values to emphasize lower driving tolerances, and normalized again. Based on these scores, we create driving service areas using the Microsoft Bing isochrone API. The estimate the service area based on modeled traffic at 6pm on a Saturday evening in July. We apply a 500 foot linear buffer to the isochrones to capture strip malls or other locations that are just outside the calculated area.
      2. Find stores within a census tract's service area: based on the service
      area of a tract, we find all the stores nearby based on their location. \
         \
         For service areas that have no locations, we increase the threshold by 10 minutes (eg. 20 to 30, 30 to 40) up to a 60 minute driving tolerance until a store or stores are in the area.
      3. Find the ultimate parent chain of the stores: for each store in the
      service area, we identify its parent chain based on the 'Parent Number'
      column of the Reference USA data. This links an individual grocery chain
      to their parent company (eg. Harris Teeter is owned by Kroger).

      4. Calculate the HHI index: based on the total sales of each parent chain
      in the service area of a tract, we calculate HHI. In essence, this measure
      reflects how dominant stores are in the area, where a value of 1
      represents total dominance (1 store has all of the sales) and a value
      closer to zero reflects a more dispersed market (0.5 means two stores have
      equal sales, 0.1 means ten stores, and so on).

      5. Normalize and interpret: We take the HHI values for each tract and
      assign a percentile value from 0 to 100 relative to all tracts. We invert
      this value so that a high value represents a competitive, diffuse market
      and a low value represents a highly concentrated market. For counties and
      states, we aggregate tract level HHI values with a population-weighted
      average, and then assign a percentile score relative to other counties or
      states.
