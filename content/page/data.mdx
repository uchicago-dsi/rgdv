Sales scaling

Not every store in our data selection sells exclusively, or even primarily, food items. To account for this, we scale the sales based on an estimated percent of category sales. Data for estimated category sales are listed below. for all other stores in non-grocery store NAICS classifications we estimate based on the average of available data: dollar stores (dollar general', 'dollar tree', 'family dollar', '99 cents only), warehouse stores ('costco', 'walmart') and department stores (target', 'big lots).
